# TIW Project 2021

My implementation of the project of the course "Informatics Technology for the Web" held @ Politecnico of Milan

## Goal

The goal of the project is to understand and familiarize myself with the technologies involved in building a web service.

The project consisted in implementing a simplified version of a university grader system where professors can grade students who can consult their marks.
 
## Technologies involved

The backend is entirely made with java servlets. The frontend is made both with a template engine such as Themeleaf and with pure javascript
